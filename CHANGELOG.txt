High-level overview of changes

Format:
+ new feature
* bug or behavior fix
i internal refactoring/structural change. No external or behavioural differences.

We attempt to use meaningful version numbers, following semver.org:
	Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
	MAJOR version when you make backwards-incompatible changes,
	MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
	PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


1.2
----
* Add basic unit tests to check parsing and validation
* Change DTD parsing to retrieve the first error, rather than the last
+ On DTD parsing error, print the offending line and highlight the place where the error might be
  (to help with troubleshooting and fixing)
* Convert error for empty DTD values to warning (empty DTD values will work, but may not be what you want)
* Fix bug parsing '%S' matches in .properties files
* Fix bug detecting when one language contains a .properties string substitution that is not in the baseline
+ Properly detect when the baseline contains a .properties string substitution that is not found in all other languages
* Fix and improve many behaviours for parsing .properties files (thanks to foudfou for inspiring this with a pull request):
	* .properties comments can also start with !
	* Allow many additional characters in .properties keys .-+\{}[]!@#$%^&*()/<>,?;'"`~|
	* Allow : to separate .properties keys and values
	* Allow whitespace between key names and values
	* Allow whitespace before key names
	* Comment characters # and ! can be used inside .properties values
	.properties file parsing should now more closely match the specification and tests run against Firefox
+ Add Mozilla-specific test: no more than 10 unique string substitutions in any .properties value
* Fix .properties comment regex
+ Optimization: skip blank lines when parsing .properties files
* Convert assertions to normal errors and make the script exit normally/gracefully under those conditions (ensures we always have consistent output and can be called on anything)
* Copyedit feedback messages
+ Add several new info missages when parsing
* Copyedit README
i Refactor localization parsing and storage into its own class
