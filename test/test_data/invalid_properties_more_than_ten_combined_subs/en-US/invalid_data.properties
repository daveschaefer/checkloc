#Firefox does not allow more than ten string substitution parameters, for performance reasons.

# the error actually happens if you pass more than 10 parameters inside javascript code.
# however, we should flag this as it probably won't do what the author intended.

# here we have < 10 numbered substitutions and < 10 non-numbered, but more than 10 unique subs total.
# as this would mean passing more than 10 parameters in the code, it's not valid.
