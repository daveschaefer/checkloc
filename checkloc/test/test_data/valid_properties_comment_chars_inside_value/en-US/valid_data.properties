# It is valid to use .properties file comment characters ! or # inside a value
# this should not affect the parsing of the value - the entire value should still be used.
# A good way to test for this is to create a .properties string that uses numbered string substitutions;
# if the entire value is not used due to # or ! inside the value string,
# the parser will flag a false-positive error thinking that the string substitutions don't match.
